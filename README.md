# AboutMe
My name is Dominik. I am 15 years old student from Czech Republic. <br>
I started with HTML and CSS, then a tried JS and Python but i didnt like it, so i tried to do small programs in Java usually about working with folders. I swapped back to Python, it lasts me long becouse making discord bots and other programs was entertaining.
Now im working in Unity trying to make 2D simple games and in Python with random ideas.
My small dream si to build factory game (something like factorio or rimworld).

## Programing
